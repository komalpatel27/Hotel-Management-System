        OF OUR AESTHETIC IDENTITY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR PERSONAL & CULTURAL 
        PERSPECTIVE”</b></font></p>
      <p> “Wedding”- an occasion where the bride, groom & their families showcase 
        their individuality by creating an ambiance that reflects their personality. 
        “WEDDING SOLUTIONS” helps realize fantasies by showcasing that unique 
        style & individuality. Our Clients tastes & style is reflected through 
        all the aspects of our wedding décor like : cards & accompaniments, cuisine, 
        décor, entertainment, lighting. </p>
      <p align="center"><font size="3"><b><font color="#800000">"WEDDING DAY THE 
        MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF ONES LIFE" </font></b></font></p>
      <p>Just as dressing up oneself for a formal event is essential, so is venue 
        dressing for a wedding. When we create a décor, we are transforming the 
        venue from the mundane to something extraordinary. And it is this creation 
        that is a signature of the client making themselves and their guest feel 
        special & respected. </p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>"WEDDING PLANNERS ARE 
        LIKE CATALYSTS…YOUR FAMILY'S INPUT IS IMPORTANT TOO…"</b></font></p>
      <p> Each and everyone is talented and every family has a long and colorful 
        history behind it. One doesn't’t need decorators alone to jazz up a venue. 
        Your families past and creative skills can also be put to use. Antique 
        artifacts, grandma’s rich silken fabrics, vintage Chester, silver Victorian 
        candle stands … any of this could be uniquely put to use to create magic 
        and that something special which is unique only to your family. Remember 
      </p>

        COLLECT ANYTHING THAT FASCINATES YOU, THAT HIGHLIGHTS YOUR PERSONAL ASPECT”. 
        Believe it or not they can come very handy when need be. MY SIGNATURE 
        STYLE: “ LESS IS BEAUTIFUL”</b></font></p>
      <p> Style is a balance of our aesthetic identity within the context of our 
        personal & cultural perspective. Candles are my lifeline. I also swear 
        by natural elements like maple leafs, fresh Hawaiian floral, stones, bamboo 
        twigs, mirrors, pearls, crystals, furs & velvet - all this to be incorporated 
        to create magic</p>
